At this time this application contain following  features:
    Login Page
-  You have to enter user id ( as given in the txt files i.e u1,u2,u7 etc) and then click on login to login to app.   //Here I have implemented the setCurrentUser 
-  If you enter wrong id or if user does not exist against the id then it will give you an error message
